- looked into picorv32 implementation by grug huhler (https://github.com/grughuhler/picorv32/tree/main)
- we need to split into two teams
	- implement this on different synthesis tool like cadence/synopsis
	- make a block diagram -refer to ravensoc and based on grug huhler's picorv32

- there are other teams working on SoCs -we have competition, and we need to make the best core to get budget for tapeout.
- try to make RAM a peripheral
- grug huhler's implementation might not be a single cycle CPU - need to check it.
- we are looking for a new person -we need confirmation by wednesday
