# RISC-V

this is a project that i have been working on for a while, where so far i've explored making a RISCV core from scratch, a picorv32 SoC implementation, and possibly more to come


## Overview

**main** branch contains the readme file with directions to different development branches

**Basic_RISCV_core** branch contains a custom RV32I core implementation

**picorv32_SoC** branch contains an SoC implementation of the [picorv32 RISCV core by YosysHQ](https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32)

**RISCV_notes** contain a progress document and other related notes that i used to develop everything
